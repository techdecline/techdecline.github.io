This is me. Proud father, husband and technology enthusiast for the longest time living and working in Dresden, Germany.

Driven by my main traits (being lazy *and* creative), I work in IT mostly for the sake of automating the tedious tasks of our day-to-day's job.

Rooting for PowerShell since it's creation (working in Windows environments for the better part of my career), I swiftly shifted away from traditional IT into all things Cloud, DevOps, SRE and Platform Engineering in the past.
